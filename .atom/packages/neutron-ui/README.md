# Neutron UI Theme for Atom

An (almost) flat theme in shades of gunmetal and medium-contrast colors. **Pair it with the [Neutron Syntax Theme](http://atom.io/packages/neutron-syntax)**.

Inspired by [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray), forked from the [Atom port](https://github.com/cannikin) by @cannikin.

## Notes:

  * The [complementing syntax theme](http://atom.io/packages/neutron-syntax) changes line-height, which is currently bugged. If your cursor appears out of place, switch tabs and it'll sort itself out.
  * Use "Show scroll bars: When scrolling" in System Preferences > General or your scrollbars will look like crap.
  * The font used in the screenshots is [Inconsolata-g](https://github.com/brentd/neutron-syntax/blob/master/Inconsolata-g.otf?raw=true) at 15pt. If installed it'll be picked up automatically by the syntax theme.
