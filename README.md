# D4rkr00tsâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want.
The bootstrapper script will create symlinks for few needed files and also updates DOTFILES path in .bash_profile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d4rkr00t/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./sync.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./sync.sh
```
